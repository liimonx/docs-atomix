- Add component variant showcase with easy switching
- Include usage context examples (cards, forms, etc.)

#### Enhanced Documentation
- Add visual badges for component status (stable, beta, deprecated)
- Include usage statistics and popularity indicators
- Add related components section with visual links
- Implement expandable sections for detailed information

### 3. Navigation & Information Architecture

#### Improved Sidebar
- Add collapsible sections for better organization
- Implement breadcrumb navigation for better context

- Add search result preview snippets

### 4. Performance & Accessibility

#### Performance Optimizations
- Implement code splitting for better loading times
- Add lazy loading for images and components
- Optimize asset delivery (SVG icons, etc.)
- Improve caching strategies

#### Accessibility Enhancements
- Add better focus indicators
- Improve keyboard navigation
- Implement ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Add high-contrast mode toggle
